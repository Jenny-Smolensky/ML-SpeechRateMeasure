# Speech Rate Meassure Project

In this project, we used Machine Learning tools.
We trained neural networks to predict speech rate (in Syllables Per Seconds) of given audio file.

## Sub Modules
This project contains three projects, that can be used separately:

* ### ClassificationSpeechNet 
   Code to train a multi class classification model to predict number of vowels in an audio file. <br />
   For further documentation [README](https://github.com/Jenny-Smolensky/ClassificationSpeechNet/blob/4bc020e999e67965895065a1559bdc5e8588f831/README.md)

* ### SpeechVowelsNet
   Code to train a neural network to detect and localize vowels on given audio file. <br />
    For further documentation [README](https://github.com/almog1/SpeechVowelsNet/blob/448d057c6d62a84ae6b2a8fea3a18a7cebf430b0/README.md)

* ### LibriSpeechFilesParser
    Code to parse libri-speech data for speech measure project. <br />
    This code allows to separate each audio file according to vowels mentioned in it's corresponding alignment file. <br />
     For further documentation [README](https://github.com/Jenny-Smolensky/LibriSpeechFilesParser/blob/ffd91057493367281266af400119f64ab4cd81ab/README.md)
