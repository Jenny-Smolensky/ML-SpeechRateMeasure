# Speech Rate Meassure Project

In this project, we used Machine Learning tools.
We trained neural networks to predict speech rate (in Syllables Per Seconds) of given audio file.

## Sub Modules
This project contains three projects, that can be used separately:

* ### ClassificationSpeechNet 
      Code to train a multi class classification model to predict number of vowels in an audio file.

* ### SpeechVowelsNet
      Code to train a neural network to detect and localize vowels on given audio file.

* ### LibriSpeechFilesParser
      Code to parse libri-speech data for speech measure project.
      This code allows to separate each audio file according to vowels mentioned in it's corresponding alignment file.

For farther documentation go to README file in each of the modules.
